## Work Experience

### Software Developer

**Antalya ISAS - Antalya**

### Python Documentation Turkish Translation

**Python Software Foundation**
**December 2021 to Present**

I believe in the power of localization as a means of connecting with people from diverse cultures and backgrounds. With this in mind, I took the initiative to launch the first ever Turkish translation project for the official Python Documentation. My passion for technology, especially Python, and my desire to bridge the language barrier for Turkish-speaking individuals inspired me to embark on this journey.

Initially, I assembled a team of 10 individuals, mostly friends from my school, who shared my enthusiasm for technology and Python. My goal was to provide a high-quality, accurate and accessible version of the Python Documentation in Turkish. Through effective project management and strong collaboration, I successfully led the team and drove the project to fruition.

However, my efforts did not go unnoticed and the project quickly gained traction. The hard work and dedication of my team members attracted more contributors, and the project expanded beyond my wildest dreams. I was amazed to see the enthusiasm of these new contributors, many of whom I had never even met in person, but who were equally passionate about making the Python Documentation more accessible to Turkish-speaking individuals.

Today, I am proud to say that this project has become one of the largest Turkish localization projects for Python and has had a significant impact on the Turkish tech community. I am humbled by the experience and grateful for the opportunity to make a difference through my passion for technology and my commitment to localization.

### Created a vision processing framework for object detection

**FRC Team 7672 Scorpions Robotics - Istanbul**
**April 2021 to Present**

I developed an open-source computer vision processing framework that utilizes both Haar Cascades and machine learning algorithms for detecting and tracking specified objects in real-time. The framework is built on the widely-used OpenCV library, which provides a comprehensive suite of computer vision. Utilizing Python programming language, I created a user-friendly interface that allows developers to easily integrate object detection and tracking functionality into their projects. The framework has been designed to be scalable, flexible, and highly efficient, making it suitable for future seasons and targets.

### Participating in FIRST Robotics Competition as Head of Programming and Software Architecture

**First Robotics Competition - Istanbul**
**September 2020 to Present**

>We call FIRST Robotics Competition the ultimate Sport for the Mind. High-school student participants call
>it “the hardest fun you’ll ever have.”
>Under strict rules, limited time and resources, teams of students are challenged to raise funds, design
>a team "brand," hone teamwork skills, and build and program industrial-size robots to play a difficult
>field game against like-minded competitors. It’s as close to real-world engineering as a student can get.
>Volunteer professional mentors lend their time and talents to guide each team. Each season ends with
>an exciting FIRST Championship.

While working as a subteam leader, I had the opportunity to manage a talented team of 10 software developers with diverse technical backgrounds. I did my best to effectively coordinate the team and deliver high-quality software by utilizing agile methodologies in a fast-paced environment. I worked to effectively communicate with the team, delegate tasks, and help align everyone with the project's goals and objectives.

### Made a Discord Bot with Python

**Freelance - Antalya**
**June 2020 to October 2020**

I developed a Discord bot with Python that provides a comprehensive set of features for users. The bot was designed to enhance the overall experience of Discord users by incorporating a wide range of functionalities that cater to various categories.

One of the key features of the bot is its music capability, which allows users to play music from a variety of sources, including YouTube and Soundcloud. The bot also comes equipped with robust moderation tools, such as the ability to mute and kick users, as well as the ability to set up custom commands for various purposes.

In addition to its practical features, the bot also includes a range of entertainment functions. Users can enjoy games such as trivia, and engage in fun conversations with the bot using its AI-powered chat functionality. Overall, the bot provides an enjoyable and interactive experience for Discord users, and was designed to make the platform a more dynamic and engaging space.
